The project is from a given drug image to predict the likely effect it can have on the consumer. The dataset for this project is limited, but it came with textual descriptions of each specimen. To utilize this, I experimented with learning a joint embedding space for images and given descriptions. Apart from this, I also experimented with Meta-Learning and Multi-Class Image Classification.
